          Air Jordan is a line of basketball shoes produced by Nike, Inc.
          Related apparel and accessories are marketed under Jordan Brand. The
          silhouette of Michael Jordan served as inspiration to create the
          "Jumpman" logo.

          The Air Jordan is famous because these shoes are made with the highest
          quality materials. There will be a cost connection to any product made
          with high-quality material. However, people have seen that the cost
          associated with their Air Jordan is not too much, unlike other shoes
          of comparable quality.
